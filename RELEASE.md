# Release standards and procedures

## Versioning

Dreditor follows the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) standard.

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

* MAJOR version when the new release contains incompatible API changes.

  ```diff
  -1.2.5
  +2.0.0
  ```
* MINOR version when the new release adds new functionality in a
  backwards-compatible manner.

  ```diff
  -1.2.5
  +1.3.0
  ```
* PATCH version when the new release contains backwards-compatible bug fixes.

  ```diff
  -1.2.5
  +1.2.6
  ```

Additional suffixes for pre-releases or build numbers may be appended, separated
by a dash/hyphen.

## Release Process

Examples assume that:
* Current version is `1.2.5` and new version is `1.2.6`.
* `origin` refers to [unicorn-fail/dreditor]

1. Ensure that you have the latest code and HEAD is clean:

    ```sh
    $ git checkout 1.x
    $ git reset --hard
    $ git pull origin 1.x
    ```

1. Confirm that Dreditor works correctly:

    ```sh
    $ grunt build
    $ grunt test
    ```

1. Increase the version number:

    ```sh
    $ grunt release
    ```

    This bumps the PATCH version in `package.json`. Alternatively:

    * To bump the MINOR version: `grunt release:minor`
    * To bump the MAJOR version: `grunt release:major`

    ```diff
    $ git diff
    diff --git a/package.json b/package.json

    ```

1. Commit the version change:

    ```sh
    $ git add package.json
    $ git commit -m "Dreditor 1.2.6"
    ```

1. Create an annotated tag for the release:

    ```sh
    $ git tag -m 1.2.6 1.2.6
    ```

1. Push the new version commit and tag:

    ```sh
    $ git push origin 1.x --tags
    ```

1. Verify that the new release and all builds appear on the [build page].

1. Test whether the new release installs and works correctly in each browser.

All performed operations up till here can be reverted in case something went
wrong.

## Publishing releases

Proceed with publishing the newly built extensions.

Examples assume that:
* Current version is `1.2.5` and new version is `1.2.6`.
* `origin` refers to [unicorn-fail/dreditor.github.io]
